# Library Project

This project is a simple web application for managing a personal library. It allows users to add, delete, and mark books in their collection as read or unread. The data is stored locally in the browser, so the information is retained between sessions.

## Features

- **Add Books:** Users can add new books to their library by entering the title, author, number of pages, and whether they have read it or not.
- **Delete Books:** Users can remove books from their library.
- **Mark as Read:** Users can toggle the read status of a book (read/unread).
- **Local Storage:** The library data is saved in the browser, so books are preserved even if the page is closed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS:** Visual styles of the application.
- **JavaScript:** Logic and functionality of the application, including DOM manipulation, local storage, and library management.
